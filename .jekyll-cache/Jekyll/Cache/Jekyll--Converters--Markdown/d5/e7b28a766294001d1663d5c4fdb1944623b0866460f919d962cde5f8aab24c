I"g<p>After our council selected a new principal, I reached out to a number of folks I knew - some JCPS employees, some not - who had first-hand experience with a change of principal. How did it affect them? How did it affect the school community (parents and staff both)? Is, in their estimation, the Principal Selection process JCPS has the best solution?</p>
