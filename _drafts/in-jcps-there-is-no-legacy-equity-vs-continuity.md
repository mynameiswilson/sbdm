title: '"In JCPS there is no legacy" - Equity vs. Continuity'
---

After our council selected a new principal, I reached out to a number of folks I knew - some JCPS employees, some not - who had first-hand experience with a change of principal. How did it affect them? How did it affect the school community (parents and staff both)? Is, in their estimation, the Principal Selection process JCPS has the best solution?

Most, if not all, **agreed that the principal select process in place is as good as it can be**: both representative* and equitable. 

Representative in that it allows for feedback from the community. Equity in that it takes great pains to ensure that there is no favor given to any candidate.

But what it does *not* do is guarantee or promote continuity. In the case of a failing school or a school where discrimination and bias is a problem, I can see the process as it is as a godsend. But, for a school - like LPAS - that is on a good trajectory and with the possibility of a deeply invested successor to take the helm, the process is a mixed bag.

Don't get me wrong - equity is _the right thing_ to do, almost always. But why fiddle with something that is clearly working _so well_, and is poised to continue that trajectory?

As one JCPS employee told me: "Well, that's the thing: in JCPS, there is no legacy"


The impact to the school community when a change of principal happens, especially in engageed, invested communities like LPAS, is bound to be considerable. But also - unknown. 

Because principals are important.



Further - candidacies are also held in private throughout the entire process, to protect the privacy of those looking to move on. But that's standard awkward "I'm looking for a job but I don't want my boss to know" stuff, right? We've all been there.

On its face, I understand why this process is why it is - to help prevent bias or discrimination. Personally, I'm glad for this, though I think I would have to steel myself to 

But on the flipside, leaving the principal selection up to an SBDM Council Committee**, can disrupt a good trend (or alternately improve a bad trend). 

But, unpacking this a bit - having your job selected by a council of peers - and in most cases a council of yor 


The SBDM being involved is a testiment to the former. 

The great pains taken to make the process both open to feedback from the public and private in the actualy selection itself is a testiment to the latter.



So then, the 

For those (like myself) who are not public-sector 

For many public-sector employees, this lack of regarded as a fact of life. While you may do everything you can to rise to the next rung - that decision is ultimately up to 

Most regarded it as a fact of life in JCPS - principals come, principals go, some hang around for years, some move, looking for the right fit. (And some are removed!) Like any job, really. Except this person leads an entire school.




All of them, to a person, understood the process and why it is structured the way it is. 

* Note: [Thanks to Governor Bevin in 2016](https://www.wave3.com/story/31718760/bill-gives-jcps-superintendent-more-influence-in-principal-selection/) In Jefferson County, and only Jefferson County, the superintendent has the ultimate authority to select principals.  The SBDM Councils make "recommendations" that the superintendent then approves. I'm told by JCPS offiicials it is _very_ rare for the superintendent to ignore an SBDM - but the option is there. In other counties?
