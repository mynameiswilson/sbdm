"Improving student achievement through family engagement. ALL families".

That's why. 

You can stop reading now if you are short on time!

I figure all goals should be brief like a mantra. Above is mine for anything I do for LPAS. Volunteering in class, tutoring, helping with events, working on community projects, coaching the cross-country team, or working with this SBDM Council. 

It's good to have a mantra - because as a representative or a leader, I've learned the hard way you spend a lot of time diving deep into comments, questions and concerns. It's easy to lose sight of the big picture, the big goal. A mantra like this is a guide star.

### Family Engagement for All Families ###

Family engagement for ALL families is my goal. Since joining the LPAS community 7 years ago, I've seen what it can do to raise up students and families alike like a great tide. When families connect with other families, that's a community. Community is incredibly valuable: if you can achieve "community" so many more students thrive and succeed. 

But it's also precarious - most families are only there for 6 years, and there's a constant outflow of graduation and a constant inflow of new families. To keep a dynamic community like this healthy and thriving, it requires a lot of planning and a lot of work. It also requires a dedication to principles (and princiPALs) to make it work.

In my day job, I'm a  "strategist" meaning I spend a lot of time listening, researching, collaborating, planning things to get people engaged with for- and non-profit organzations. What I've learned is that you have to have values and principles baked into everything you do, or it *just won't work*. 

### The shared concepts that make engagement work ###

* **Transparency**: One part being open, the other part listening and responding to the needs of your community.
* **Authenticity**: Walking the walk and practicing what you preach. Every. Day.
* **Equity**: Making sure everyone in the community is not only seen and heard, but that they are represented.

I think for the first two concepts, LPAS scores highly, but work will always be needed.

I think for the third - equity - LPAS (and JCPS...and Louisville) could do better. 

### Where I think the LPAS Community needs to go ###

LPAS, like most magnet schools, is diverse by design. ([See for yourself!](https://assessment.jefferson.kyschools.us/PublicDatasets/pdf/2021/47_Current_Enrollment_Race_Gender_ES.pdf)) More diverse racially than Louisville itself, thanks to white flight to private schools. From my perspective and in my experience, family-involved groups (SBDM, PTA, volunteering) are not and have not been reflective of this diversity. This has been acknowledged to me personally, but with the same wearied frustration I'm sure you've heard before: "We've tried, but..." 

But what?

It's easy to ignore this issue when you are working to raise money for your child and the children of your friends for the time *they'll be at LPAS* - but what about those coming into the school next year and 6 years later? How will it change for them? 

If you are committed to the community - an ever-changing, flowing, dynamic community of families present and future - then ensuring that all families are represented in your ranks and in the decisions you make is important. 

> The LPAS Community should look as much like it's student population as possible, in all demographics: race, gender, geographics, and economic situation as possible. It doesn't right now, and that means we've got work to do. 

I stood for this as the coach of our cross-country team, and I stand here now for the same as an SBDM rep.

I think most everyone, regardless of race, recognizes this is needed. JCPS itself has implemented REAP protocols. The LPAS admin and staff have (from my perspective as a white man) has always been respective and sensitive to the whole community. But we as a community need to do the same - not just for our children, but for those who come after us.

### So then - what is it that I'll do to help this? ###

Well, an SBDM Parent Representative my capability and focus is limited to the following: **school policies**, **school budget and staffing** and **some hiring** (most notably principal hiring). Those things carry great weight and import - but they aren't *everything*. In-class, day-to-day and those things that JCPS has outright control over (admissions policies, for example) are things outside.

Beyond that, there are privileges that you have granted me in electing me. A requirement of being a representative is being available, listening, and guiding. I'll do those things and I will implore other representatives do the same. I will also push to ensure that everything the SBDM does is as **accessible** as possible - meetings, notes, actions. 

Finally, I will provide the school and the district with the insights I have as a parent and a professional strategist on ways to improve family engagement.  

We've got a long way to go, but that's the work. And I'm here for it.

As always, **do not hesitate** to contact me. I want to hear from you, because that's the job of representation. 

Love you all! See you soon...
