"Improving  student achievement through family engagement".

That's why. 

Wow, that was brief. 

I figure all mantras should be brief - and this is mine - for anything I do for LPAS. Volunteering in class, tutoring, helping with events, working on community projects, or coaching  the cross-country team. It should all be about improving student achievement.

I'm a big believer than a engaged families make great students. And further when families connect with other families, that's a  community. And if you can achieve "community" so many more students thrive and succeed. 

That effect isn't limited  to students, either. Teacher, staff and administration can do so much more with what little they are provided when there's an engaged, invested community.

With my daughter having just graduated from LPAS and my son entering third grade, it struck me that I only had three years left to give what I could to a community that has been nothing short of life-changing for all in my family. What could I give? Where could I be most helpful? More volunteering? The PTA? 

What about the SBDM? My wife had served a term from  2016-2018, and suggested "you'd like it. it's *really* interesting, and you are responsible for some critical things like hiring, budgets and school policy".

Frankly, my first response was one of concern that I was under-qualified for this. I'm not an educator (though I've certainly thought about it) and I've never served on a council. But...as a friend once remarked, "you're the guy in the jury who 'reaches for the pencil' in the middle of the table" to move things forward. And, professionally, my work is goal-setting, communication and collaboration.

So, when there is a yearly opening on the SBDM for one of  the two parent representatives (staggered, two-year terms) in the  fall of 2020,  I discussed with a few friends and teachers who had sat on an SBDM Council, and decided to throw my hat in the ring with a number of other nominees.

(You can see my candidate bio I submitted, along with all other nominees, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1qPZ7u95Z_aWTji28vAffEOSWyvD_yTLFtXpQwmbwB1c/mobilebasic?fbclid=IwAR3OtCIcp962_zKl2a89Zu2QdptBaX7eQ3iENOiUV-5x8wFemN036K7hIQg).)

And I won*.





I'd like to lay out my goals and priorities clearly:

Goal: Student Achievement
This  goes for anyone on SBDM ... it's in the law!

Priority: Promoting family engagement in the school in all matters.

- Transparency
- Communication
- Diversity

SBDM is  incredibly important to student achievement - I'd say moreso even than an amazing PTA (which we have, too!). Why? Because the SBDM has control over budget, principal selection (TODO), school policies


* At least, I think I won. The PTA runs the election, and they said I won, and it was announced, but I haven't seen vote counts... but that's just the transparency and election nerd in me talking.
