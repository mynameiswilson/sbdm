excerpt: "Hybrid schedule, vaccine rollouts and hard work by your schools have changed things in a short few weeks."

After a pandemic year that seemed 10 years long, things have dramatically changed in the last 3 weeks since I last wrote about reopening JCPS to in-person learning. So much so that my JCPS students are going back to school, in-person, starting Thursday. 

For those keeping pace of the changes, you might be familiar with the reasons, but for those not, here's a quick summary:

First and foremost, during the February 25th JCPS Board of Education meeting, Council member Chris Brady "called an audible". It had become clear that council members were still very concerned about JCPS' ability to reopen safely with appropriate social distancing five days a week. Mr. Brady made the motion for JCPS to reopen using a hybrid plan where students would be split into two groups, each attending school 2 days a week. 

The ground shook. For many parents concerned about social distancing, this would mitigate that issue. For the Superintendent and public health officials pushing full-time in-person schooling, this was a rebuke. For individual schools, this threw weeks of hurried planning out the window.  

For me, personally, this was a surprise. I'll admit to being gobsmacked when he made that motion, though that quickly faded to a realization that this hybrid plan was precisely what the Kentucky General Assembly was also suggesting. It overcame one of the biggest flaws in JCPS' plan.

After further debate and comment - including a critical request for JCPS to put forth an Equity Plan to address achievement gaps - the Board passed the motion, effectively reopening schools. 

The effect was dramatic - almost immediately you could see elementary families shifting their preferences

The option to have your students stay remote in non-traditional instruction (NTI) was and still remains. That's where I was after the February 26th meeting for my students. Only recently did we make the decision to
move our students to in-person, and here's why:

1) Vaccine rollout is moving quickly (and positivity rate is falling)
2) My wife is now fully vaccinated &amp; I hope to be fully vaccinated very soon 
3) Safety plans have been updated and detailed for both schools
4) We have the ability to drop off and pick up our students from school 

In short, the virus is being combatted effectively, and we have the ability to mitigate our personal risks. This is not the case with all families.
