---

Hello LPAS Families and Friends! Below are my notes from the September 19th 2021 LPAS SBDM standing meeting. 

*Note: I'm one of two parent reprensentatives, so my notes are slanted towards parent/family topics. As far as notes go, they are probably incomplete, and are definitely not "official". Official agendas and approved minutes are posted on the* [*LPAS SBDM page*](http://lincoln.jefferson.kyschools.us/groups/14915/site_based_decision_making_council_sbdm/sbdm) and [*JCPS SBDM Council and Standing Committee Minutes site*](https://sppublic.jefferson.kyschools.us/sbdm/SitePages/Home.aspx).

[September 21, 2021 Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xaznlC50p6O33iiWeHx1mkj_AF6vyMoY/edit)

### Good News ###
- Ms. Hutto has been voted in as new teacher rep for the departing Ms. Craven.
- Mr. Evans ran unopposed for SBDM teach rep, so his term continues.


### Committee Reports ###

**CSIP** Phase 1 is underway, focused on school safety. Ms. Marstelter is heading this up.

**Backpack of Success**

**Racial Equity** goals have been set. 1) Implementing culuturally diverse teaching and learning strategies 2) focus on validating and affirming the diverse cultural identities of students. To accomplish this by March 2022 they will use the Racial Equity Reflection Guide.

### Staffing ###
- We are fully staffed custodially! New custodian James Griffin!
- We are getting 1/2 of an ECE teacher. 
- Ms. Davis - a former long-term sub - will be filling Ms. Graham's 3rd grade. 

### Student Achievement Updates ###
We reviewed [Fall 2021 MAP Scores](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xgicH0YWXzrfjyN2NxBoccCcbil5HU7W/edit).

Overall, LPAS is right around national average. We are slightly ahead in reading, slightly behind in math, which is consistent with history. Students will be getting individualized student reports soon. 

### Budget ####
- Nothing much to discuss. A few expenses (cross country, etc). 

### Policy Review ###
**Emergency Plan** 
Reviewed. No updates.

**Committees Policy**
Reviewed. Small semantic update on School Improvement Plan.

**Wellness**
Reviewed. I relayed a concern from parent that wellness was sometimes being used as a disciplinary tool. Our Wellness policy prevents the school from restricting physical activity (e.g. taking away recess) as a disciplinary measure. 

I asked about LPAS' current disciplinary use of wellness. I was told that "removing choice of activity for a period of time" is sometimes use as a disciplinary measure (e.g. instructing the student to walk laps versus playing kickball or tag for five minutes). The discussion among staff was that there are relatively few levers that can be pulled by teachers. 

Ms. Case has pledged to review with staff, and asks parents for feedback as well.

**Extracurricular Programs**
I received guidance from Dr. Jim Jury - KHSAA (middle and high school)

**Comprehensive School Survey**

Overall we are doing pretty well. YOu can check the JCPS website.

**Future Policy Reviews** We are to read Emergency Management, Wellness prior to next meeting.

**Classroom Assessment** Reviewed. No edits.

**Improvement Planning** Reviewed. No edits.

**Primary Program** Ms. Case would like to review other schools policies here before our next reading. 

### Old Business ### 

### New Business ###

**SBDM Elections and Replacements** 

The PTA holds our SBDM elections - so if families have questions on how / when that will take place, you should contact [the LPAS PTA President](https://sites.google.com/view/lpaspta/lpas-pta-board-members). Traditionally, it has taken place during our Fall Festival in October, but there is also an Open House planned for September 23, 2021.

Kentucky Department of Education says that SBDM elections must be held in-person, as the state rescinded the COVID policies June 11, 2021.

See you in September!
