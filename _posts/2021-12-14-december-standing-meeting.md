excerpt: "SBDM Standing Meeting for December 2021"

Hello LPAS Families and Friends! Below are my notes from December 14 2021 meeting.

My notes here are brief as we are back to being in-person. See the agendas and [official minutes](https://sppublic.jefferson.kyschools.us/sbdm/SitePages/Home.aspx) for more details.

*Note: I'm one of two parent reprensentatives, so my notes are slanted towards parent/family topics. As far as notes go, they are probably incomplete, and are definitely not "official". Official agendas and approved minutes are posted on the* [*LPAS SBDM page*](http://lincoln.jefferson.kyschools.us/groups/14915/site_based_decision_making_council_sbdm/sbdm) and [*JCPS SBDM Council and Standing Committee Minutes site*](https://sppublic.jefferson.kyschools.us/sbdm/SitePages/Home.aspx).


### December 14, 2021 ###
[December 14, 2021 Agenda & Docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jsXNY-WSpr49Bm6lg3VReT3N1GDrhWfV)

- Backpack Defenses, March 28-30 2022. Likely to be in-person at LPAS. [Sign up here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf68YGF1y0z4Vohe1Ruz9hK2U_DmDnKP-RPa4Y5wpJWr16cbA/viewform)

- Staffing update: Yet another applicant came and went. Most recent applicant was offering a single-school position, so she accepted that instead of our 1/2 position that we'd share with Middletown. Working on finding another.

- Student achievement: initial MAP scores indicate that there has been considerable growth since last year, notably in reading. Math continues to be a focus.

#### The LPAS CSIP has arrived! ####

The CSIP is the "[Comprehensive School Improvement Plan](https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/data-management-planning-and-program-evaluation-division/planning-and-program-evaluation/cdipcsip)" - and one is created each year for every JCPS school.

The CSIP for LPAS has just been released, and you can read it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WuwH8s6S3EoX8_r793HpFwyx6n2GrgMB).

- Writing and Reading are two areas (especially among Black and Hispanic students) where LPAS needs most improvement.

- As a part of CSIP and professional development: LPAS is implementing some aspects of the "Jennifer Serravallo Writing Strategies" plan and "Jan Richardson model for effective reading strategies". Both of which are district-level initiatives. In addition, trauma-informed care.

- CSIP Goals by 2024:
MAP Reading from 58.4% to 65%
MAP Mathematics from 47.7% to 54% (Including improving African-American and Hispanic subgroups 7% each to 34.9% and 40.9%, respectively.)
Kentucky State Assessment Writing from 35.4% to 42%

- Professional Development: Our JCPS "Professional Development" plan was presented. First priority: culturally responsive teaching. Writing is the second priority. Both of these align to LPAS' Comprehensive School Improvement Plan.

- Security: the district is now not going pay for cameras for elementary school, so we are back to using our school funds for security cameras. 

#### REAP Analysis ####

We performed our first [REAP analyses](https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/department/diversity-equity-poverty-division/school-based-decision-making/council-member-resources)! REAP is a racial equity analysis protocol that is intended to be a lens through which to assess the impact of school policies, and it's been around since late 2019. 

Not sure why it's taken us this long to start using it (LPAS being a very diverse school) - but I have been asking about it, and it was attempted today with two items: [Professional Development Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16gnQvVGAvc8R77jXTIojh5KGpAH7bVpM/view?usp=sharing) and the [ESSER funds priorities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pbJ4oq47KXH3ESbsH1sFJxSHNIQ853Li/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114059578499564788568&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

The REAP is intended to be used for policies. Neither of these two things are policies - but rather outcomes from things that policies have put into place. So we did our best. It was a good learning experience, but ill-fitting. 

Most importantly, the council took it seriously and we all see value in the REAP process. Looking forward to using it in the future for our school policies.

See you in January!
