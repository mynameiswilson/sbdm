excerpt: "A reflection on my time as SBDM parent representative for LPAS (2020-2022)"
---

This month will be my final month as one of two parent representatives for LPAS' SBDM council. 

It has been an honor to serve a community that I owe much of my personal growth to. I hope I served you well.

We did good work, this council. In my term, we: 

* successfully navigated a momentous change of administration
* put considerable focus on Exceptional Child Education (ECE), and populations that needed help the most throughout the pandemic
* hired a full-time mental health practitioner
* hired from within for our Counselor position and full-time Gifted & Talented positions
* approved funding for security upgrades the building
* wrote and approved the [first-ever LGBTQ+ equity policy in JCPS (and maybe the state)](https://benwilson.org/sbdm/policy/LGBTQIA-equity-diversity-policy-update/)
* and a LOT of other stuff.

I can't take credit for any more of the above than my one seat (of six) should grant me. I am most proud of the work we did _together_. 

Meanwhile, the school is here:

* Teacher satisfaction, regarding leadership and climate - [according to the 2022 IMPACT survey](https://secure.panoramaed.com/impactky/understand/8121875/summary) - is on the rise (and well above JCPS averages). 
* The school has never had more arts-trained staff (arts staff + grade-level teachers both).
* The PTA is revitalized and engaging families in new ways. 
* LPAS is the model for performing arts magnets. In fact, it wants to build another elementary arts magnet! 

LPAS' future is bright.

### What I Learned

Through this "adventure" I am better for it. I learned to be careful with words. I learned to reach out. I learned to listen. I learned to make my time count. 

I learned to represent a community.

Being a "representative" forced me to consider issues through a holistic lens, and not a personal one. To think less about my current students, and the _thousands_ that my actions and decisions will impact in the coming decades.

I want to leave you with this - an enduring thought I've had that I've constantly tested for truth:

**There is no legacy in a school, there is only constant change.**

It's a flow, it's a process. It is unceasing and unyielding. The best thing you can do is to learn from the past and focus instead on setting up the future - through budgets, hiring, policies and processes - for success.

I was humbled to be a small part of that change. You should be a part of that change.
