<p>“Improving  student achievement through family engagement”.</p>

<p>That’s why.</p>

<p>Wow, that was brief.</p>

<p>I figure all mantras should be brief - and this is mine - for anything I do for LPAS. Volunteering in class, tutoring, helping with events, working on community projects, or coaching  the cross-country team. It should all be about improving student achievement.</p>

<p>I’m a big believer than a engaged families make great students. And further when families connect with other families, that’s a  community. And if you can achieve “community” so many more students thrive and succeed.</p>

<p>That effect isn’t limited  to students, either. Teacher, staff and administration can do so much more with what little they are provided when there’s an engaged, invested community.</p>

<p>With my daughter having just graduated from LPAS and my son entering third grade, it struck me that I only had three years left to give what I could to a community that has been nothing short of life-changing for all in my family. What could I give? Where could I be most helpful? More volunteering? The PTA?</p>

<p>What about the SBDM? My wife had served a term from  2016-2018, and suggested “you’d like it. it’s <em>really</em> interesting, and you are responsible for some critical things like hiring, budgets and school policy”.</p>

<p>Frankly, my first response was one of concern that I was under-qualified for this. I’m not an educator (though I’ve certainly thought about it) and I’ve never served on a council. But…as a friend once remarked, “you’re the guy in the jury who ‘reaches for the pencil’ in the middle of the table” to move things forward. And, professionally, my work is goal-setting, communication and collaboration.</p>

<p>So, when there is a yearly opening on the SBDM for one of  the two parent representatives (staggered, two-year terms) in the  fall of 2020,  I discussed with a few friends and teachers who had sat on an SBDM Council, and decided to throw my hat in the ring with a number of other nominees.</p>

<p>(You can see my candidate bio I submitted, along with all other nominees, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1qPZ7u95Z_aWTji28vAffEOSWyvD_yTLFtXpQwmbwB1c/mobilebasic?fbclid=IwAR3OtCIcp962_zKl2a89Zu2QdptBaX7eQ3iENOiUV-5x8wFemN036K7hIQg">here</a>.)</p>

<p>And I won*.</p>

<p>I’d like to lay out my goals and priorities clearly:</p>

<p>Goal: Student Achievement
This  goes for anyone on SBDM … it’s in the law!</p>

<p>Priority: Promoting family engagement in the school in all matters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transparency</li>
  <li>Communication</li>
  <li>Diversity</li>
</ul>

<p>SBDM is  incredibly important to student achievement - I’d say moreso even than an amazing PTA (which we have, too!). Why? Because the SBDM has control over budget, principal selection (TODO), school policies</p>

<ul>
  <li>At least, I think I won. The PTA runs the election, and they said I won, and it was announced, but I haven’t seen vote counts… but that’s just the transparency and election nerd in me talking.</li>
</ul>
