Below are my notes from the January 19th 2021 LPAS SBDM meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I’m one of two parent reprensentatives, so my notes are slanted towards parent/family topics. As far as notes go, they are probably incomplete, and are definitely not “official”. Official agendas and approved minutes are posted on the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sppublic.jefferson.kyschools.us/sbdm/SitePages/Home.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;JCPS SBDM Council and Standing Committee Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first “normal” meeting since joining the SBDM back in November! Every other meeting I’ve attended was focused Principal Selection or… the fallout from the Principal Selection. So, it was genuinely nice to be able to finally welcome to Ms. Case, speak with her directly, get down to “standard” business, and hear some great news about LPAS as we move into this next chapter of LPAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also discussed putting a bow on Principal Selection, with two items: 1) posting the items the Council stated in December that we’d post and 2) reviewing the Principal Selection Policy in the February 2020 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s LPAS’ turn to get vaccines! About two weeks earlier than expected!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New playground equipment coming soon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LPAS is getting a new roof over the summer … which means no summer programs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The school’s participation rate is at 98% - well above JCPS average right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a good, brisk, productive meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID Update! Vaccines for JCPS employees are ahead of schedule&lt;/strong&gt; and proceeding alphabetically. Lincoln staff should be up Tuesday or Wednesday at Broadbent Arena. Sooner than February 1st as previously expected. Sounds like in-person school might be a possibility? Hard to say… I heard a (non-LPAS) teacher at the donut shop last week declare (eclair?) “We won’t be going back this school year. The union is too strong” … so who knows. But things are moving ahead, plans being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A couple of LPAS building updates:&lt;/strong&gt; New playground equipment coming soon. New roof for LPAS this summer! But… that also means no summer programs in the school. More details around that soon, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;annual Comprehensive School Survey&lt;/strong&gt; will be coming around soon - it’s open to the public and is a great way to have your voice heard. You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/departments/data-management-research/comprehensive&quot;&gt;past results (2012-2020) here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5th Grade backpack defenses&lt;/strong&gt; coming up (April 26th-29th) - which will be during Derby Week. Not sure what Derby will look like this year, but it’ll be a busy time. Ms. Case working on quality and quantity of backpack items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racial Equity training&lt;/strong&gt; is continuing with staff. Teachers are starting reading “So You Want to Talk about Race”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Attendance Clerk position&lt;/strong&gt; created due to Ms. Arethia’s passing closed last week. Interviews starting soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/YF-h_921ZQk&quot;&gt;Ms. Arethia was also featured on CBS This Morning in a beautiful rememberance of her life&lt;/a&gt; and impact on the LPAS community. They also call out the Arethia Tilford Sunshine Award at the end! Please watch and share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Achievement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;98% participation rate (how many kids are attending NTI) - this is REAL high for JCPS, and an improvement from December (95%). The staff and counselors were credited with their direct family engagement here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100% ECE participation rate (Ms. St John! Woo!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No updates regarding KPREP yet - Ms. Roth asked if and when they go back to school, will they go into testing. Ms. Case said likely not, but they may do MAP testing to get some data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access testing, language proficiency (ESL qualification) is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading:&lt;/strong&gt; 309 books read last week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budgets are pretty static at the moment.&lt;/strong&gt; However in February we will have our proposed school budget, so get ready for that. This is an annual “big thing” for SBDM, so if you are interested - start paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping up Principal Selection from December:&lt;/strong&gt;
Earlier this month, I had contacted the other members of the council to see where we were with the actions we said we’d take in our “Council Statement on Principal Selection”. Specifically, we said we would publish on &lt;a href=&quot;http://lincoln.jefferson.kyschools.us/groups/14915/site_based_decision_making_council_sbdm/sbdm&quot;&gt;the LPAS SBDM page&lt;/a&gt; a number of documents relative to Principal Selection - including the results of the public principal selection criteria survey. For a number of reasons - the holidays, the change in administration, etc - this had not yet been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll save you the back-and-forth, but ultimately I suggested (and the Council agreed with a “yay”) that we would publish those documents attached to the minutes from the December 15th meeting, including a link to the video recording. (As of Jan 24th this hasn’t been updated yet. Will advise!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that effectively wrapping that process, I would like to offer a thankful coda: This change, in this moment in time, has been an emotional one. I think everyone in the LPAS Community has come to realize through this change just how invested we are in our school. You spoke out publicly, privately, to this Council, to the District and you made your voices heard. It was a little messy, but your comments and concerns informed this Council’s actions. And those actions I believe led to a realization of the needs of this uniquely invested community. Keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: You can read &lt;a href=&quot;/sbdm/SBDM%20Council%20Statement%20on%20Principal%20Selection%20(2020.12.15).pdf&quot;&gt;the Council Statement here&lt;/a&gt;. You can also read the &lt;a href=&quot;/sbdm/Reflections%20on%20LPAS%20Community%20Reaction%20to%20Principal%20Selection%202020.12.15.pdf&quot;&gt;“Reflections on LPAS Community Reaction to Principal Selection”&lt;/a&gt; statement I read during our December meeting. The Survey Results will be linked in the official December 15th SBDM Minutes on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sppublic.jefferson.kyschools.us/sbdm/SitePages/Home.aspx&quot;&gt;JCPS SBDM Council and Standing Committee Minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principal Selection Policy Review: February!&lt;/strong&gt;
But wait! There’s more! (sigh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to be reviewing the Principal Selection policy &lt;em&gt;next month&lt;/em&gt; at our regular meeting. If you have feedback or thoughts, please email the Council OR sign up to speak at the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy reviews take two meetings - one for an initial review and reading, and the second to confirm any changes madee during the initial review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SBDM Page Updates Coming Soon&lt;/strong&gt;
The transparency and communication nerd in me was very happy to hear that Ms. Case wants to make the SBDM page much more useful - reorganizing it, ensuring that the upcoming dates and schedule are updated, contact info up to date and making the School Policies not one long, unsearchable PDF. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All small things - but I’m here for anything that makes this sort of critical (but often ignored) information more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;
We had a second reading of both the Wellness policy and Discipline policies. We also reviewed the Exit from Magnet Program policy (which discusses removing a student from the school for various infractions) - and it was noted that this will likely be removed from individual school policies as JCPS will be mandating policy, similar to admissions policies. They haven’t approved yet, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of Writing&lt;/strong&gt;
Ms. Jones has agreed to be our permanent Secretary! Yay for Ms. Jones!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always if you have feedback, feelings, thoughts or questions regarding SBDM stuff - feel free to contact me. If you have specific questions - please contact the school!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in February!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Wilson</name></author><category term="meetingnotes" /><summary type="html">SBDM Standing Meeting from Tuesday, January 19 2021.

ALL families”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can stop reading now if you are short on time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure all goals should be brief like a mantra. Above is mine for anything I do for LPAS. Volunteering in class, tutoring, helping with events, working on community projects, coaching the cross-country team, or working with this SBDM Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good to have a mantra - because as a representative or a leader, I’ve learned the hard way you spend a lot of time diving deep into comments, questions and concerns. It’s easy to lose sight of the big picture, the big goal. A mantra like this is a guide star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;family-engagement-for-all-families&quot;&gt;Family Engagement for All Families&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family engagement for ALL families is my goal. Since joining the LPAS community 7 years ago, I’ve seen what it can do to raise up students and families alike like a great tide. When families connect with other families, that’s a community. Community is incredibly valuable: if you can achieve “community” so many more students thrive and succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also precarious - most families are only there for 6 years, and there’s a constant outflow of graduation and a constant inflow of new families. To keep a dynamic community like this healthy and thriving, it requires a lot of planning and a lot of work. It also requires a dedication to principles (and princiPALs) to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my day job, I’m a  “strategist” meaning I spend a lot of time listening, researching, collaborating, planning things to get people engaged with for- and non-profit organzations. What I’ve learned is that you have to have values and principles baked into everything you do, or it &lt;em&gt;just won’t work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shared-concepts-that-make-engagement-work&quot;&gt;The shared concepts that make engagement work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: One part being open, the other part listening and responding to the needs of your community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authenticity&lt;/strong&gt;: Walking the walk and practicing what you preach. Every. Day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity&lt;/strong&gt;: Making sure everyone in the community is not only seen and heard, but that they are represented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think for the first two concepts, LPAS scores highly, but work will always be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think for the third - equity - LPAS (and JCPS…and Louisville) could do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-i-think-the-lpas-community-needs-to-go&quot;&gt;Where I think the LPAS Community needs to go&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LPAS, like most magnet schools, is diverse by design. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://assessment.jefferson.kyschools.us/PublicDatasets/pdf/2021/47_Current_Enrollment_Race_Gender_ES.pdf&quot;&gt;See for yourself!&lt;/a&gt;) More diverse racially than Louisville itself, thanks to white flight to private schools. The makeup of the staff and the administration, their attitudes and actions have in my (admittedly white-male) perspective done a great job of making LPAS an inclusive, respectful and equitable place to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, family-involved groups (SBDM, PTA, volunteering) are not and have not been reflective of the same diversity or actions. This has been acknowledged to me personally by a number of people, but with the same wearied frustration I’m sure you’ve heard before: “We’ve tried, but…” But what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working to ensure equitable representation and opportunity is large issue - larger than LPAS or JCPS, but it’s one where schools can have an outsized impact. Schools - and specifically magnet schools - are unique places because they cross over the boundaries created by years of institutional segregation of race and economics. Elementary schoools specifically are places where many new parents come to find “their people” and forge new relationships through this shared experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only six years, but it’s a crucial six years. And if you are committed to the community - an ever-changing, flowing, dynamic community of families present and future - then ensuring that all families are represented in your ranks and in the decisions you make is important. And I’d stake that it’s just as important as working for your child and the children of your friends for the time &lt;em&gt;they’ll be at LPAS&lt;/em&gt;. But what about those coming into the school next year and 6 years later? How will it change for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then I ask for you to get involved and if you are involved, consider ways to help make the deeply involved community at LPAS look more like the student and family population at LPAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that this position is bold - but I’ve been in or around Louisville and JCPS my entire life, and frankly I’m tired of the lazy segregation we take for granted in this town. It’s robbed us all of relationships, opportunities and experiences uncountable, and I’ve been too long ignoring that fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think public schools can be a place where this change begins, and I think we are largely on the right track. But it will take work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The involved LPAS Community (volunteers, council members, etc) should look as much like it’s student and family population as possible, in all demographics: race, gender, geographics, and economic situation as possible. It doesn’t right now, and that means we’ve got work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood for this as the coach of our cross-country team, and I stand here now for the same as an SBDM rep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My power to affect this change directly is limited, as is the time I have on this council. So then, I want to use what I have to move us forward and engage MORE families because I know the benefit that has to students and families both. This “blog” is part of that. There will be more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-then---what-is-it-that-ill-do-to-help-this&quot;&gt;So then - what is it that I’ll do to help this?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, an SBDM Parent Representative my capability and focus is limited to the following: &lt;strong&gt;school policies&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;school budget and staffing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;some hiring&lt;/strong&gt; (most notably principal hiring). Those things carry great weight and import - but they aren’t &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. In-class, day-to-day and those things that JCPS has outright control over (admissions policies, for example) are things outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, there are privileges that you have granted me in electing me. A requirement of being a representative is being available, listening, and guiding. I’ll do those things and I will implore other representatives do the same. I will also push to ensure that everything the SBDM does is as &lt;strong&gt;accessible&lt;/strong&gt; as possible - meetings, notes, actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I will provide the school and the district with the insights I have as a parent and a professional strategist on ways to improve family engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, I’ll keep up with this blog as a document of my time, but also as a guide to those who come after me who are curious as to what SBDM is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a long way to go, but that’s the work. And I’m here for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, &lt;strong&gt;do not hesitate&lt;/strong&gt; to contact me. I want to hear from you, because that’s the job of representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love you all! See you soon…&lt;/p&gt;
