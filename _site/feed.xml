Below are my notes from the February 16th 2021 LPAS SBDM meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I’m one of two parent reprensentatives, so my notes are slanted towards parent/family topics. As far as notes go, they are probably incomplete, and are definitely not “official”. Official agendas and approved minutes are posted on the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lincoln.jefferson.kyschools.us/groups/14915/site_based_decision_making_council_sbdm/sbdm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;LPAS SBDM page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sppublic.jefferson.kyschools.us/sbdm/SitePages/Home.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;JCPS SBDM Council and Standing Committee Minutes site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-hZ4s2mOHzdu8b1crcAtpwL4deJxens/edit?rtpof=true&quot;&gt;April 20, 2021 Agenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-news&quot;&gt;Good News&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“It’s just great to be back!”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students spent a lot of time on safety routines early on, but a few weeks in, it’s just like normal school (except not quite as close together)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“This is not good news - it’s GREAT news!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;committee-reports&quot;&gt;Committee Reports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much on comittee reports - admins have been asked to focus on back to school planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSIP Survey&lt;/strong&gt; may move to the fall. If done in spring it will be abbreviated. Ms. Case hopes it happens in the fall during “back to school” so it won’t be affected by NTI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backpack of Success&lt;/strong&gt;. Starts next week. Students have been practicing. Ms. Palmquist is leading that, and will be reaching out by end of week to those who signed up. I asked Ms. Case to share info on how to sign up - I don’t believe I’ve seen anything regarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staffing&quot;&gt;Staffing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Maulik is moving! Her family is moving out of state - and Ms. Coots will be teaching 2nd grade last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome Reggie Brown as a part of the janitorial staff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;student-achievement-updates&quot;&gt;Student Achievement Updates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPREP is approaching and Ms. Jones is prepping for it to start May 10th. However - California has been granted a Federal OK to not do their testing - so Kentucky might be granted the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staff-assignment--space-building-approval&quot;&gt;Staff Assignment &amp;amp; Space (Building) Approval&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are permanently adding another 1st grade teacher - the K/1 split that had existed in 2019/2020 will no longer be. We have 4 full K classes (and teachers) currently and during NTI we had added a “small group” teacher&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space plan was approved. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kESNMH21Vq3BkL1K4JDEK-0tqvafIm2X/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;April 20, 2021 Agenda for link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-review&quot;&gt;Policy Review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principal Selection policy was read a second time and approved.&lt;/strong&gt; The two major updates are that the additional committee members is expanded from three to five and we added language that recommended a committee that represented the large LPAS committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consultation for Hiring Other Than Principal&lt;/strong&gt; we reviewed and saw no changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extracurricular Programs&lt;/strong&gt; - what falls under extracurricular? Ms. Case to review. Also - note that all extracurriculars need a rationale brought to the SBDM by May 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;old-business&quot;&gt;Old Business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Old business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-business&quot;&gt;New Business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplemental School Year&lt;/strong&gt;. JCPS is working through how to implement this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summer Programs&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, no summer programs at LPAS due to roof replacement. However JCPS will be providing more information very soon. Ms Jones “No matter where students are attending summer programs, all students have access.” The Board Meeting this evening will roll out the offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End of School Year Celebrations&lt;/strong&gt;. We can have outside celebrations - but only things “critical to school culture”. Kindergarten and 5th Grade Promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Case says we are currently at 83% attendance. Was very heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to school next week Monday through Thursday of next week as Friday is Oaks Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in May!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Wilson</name></author><category term="meetingnotes" /><category term="sbdm" /><summary type="html">SBDM Standing Meeting from Tuesday, April 20 2021.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-news&quot;&gt;Good News&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going back to school tomorrow!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;committee-reports&quot;&gt;Committee Reports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much on comittee reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSIP Survey&lt;/strong&gt; nothing to report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backpack of Success&lt;/strong&gt;. Working on backpack plans. (I ended up doing Backpack Defenses for Noe Middle in early March! - ben)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racial Equity&lt;/strong&gt; nothing to report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staffing&quot;&gt;Staffing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Kate Benedict re-interviewed due to transfer process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of subs in the building with the Hybrid schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;student-achievement-updates&quot;&gt;Student Achievement Updates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing to report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;budget&quot;&gt;Budget&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve maintained staffing levels in our budget similar to last couple of years. Though, per 2/16/2021 meeting we are going to be down one ESL teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-review&quot;&gt;Policy Review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the &lt;strong&gt;Policy waiver&lt;/strong&gt; amendment: we agreed that waiver policy as written was OK in that council sets timeframe for the waiver in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the second reading on the &lt;strong&gt;Principal Selection&lt;/strong&gt; policy, we received guidance from Dr. Stenton that yes, you may have any number of people on the selection committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-business-aka-reopening&quot;&gt;New Business AKA Reopening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Case offered a few stats on reopening: no classes will have over 15 students. There will be 210 students per diem in the school (as of March 16th - this likely went up as the school year progressed - ben).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Morning Meeting will come back 3/24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access Testing from 3/1 to 4/27. An abbreviated KPREP for 3rd thru 5th in May. MAP Testing is NOT happening - though “this would be preferred”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much so that we’ve decided that our JCPS students are going back to school, in-person, starting Thursday. This is something I did not expect to happen because I could not anticipate the progress we’ve seen. I’m not sure anyone did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know most JCPS families have been making decisions to stay remote or go in-person. I think it’s important to have more of these conversations out in the open and to share, so in that interest here is our family’s “why”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olBU9uLBD2w&quot;&gt;the February 25th JCPS Board of Education meeting&lt;/a&gt;, Council member Chris Brady “called an audible”. It had become clear that council members were still very concerned about JCPS’ ability to reopen safely with appropriate social distancing five days a week. Mr. Brady made the motion for JCPS to reopen using a hybrid plan where students would be split into two groups, each attending school 2 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ground shook. For many parents concerned about social distancing, this would mitigate that issue. For the Superintendent and public health officials pushing full-time in-person schooling, this was more than a bit of a rebuke. For individual schools, this threw weeks of hurried planning out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally speaking, this was a surprise. There had been no conversation around any sort of alternative plan to reopening. When he made that motion, I was gobsmacked! That feeling quickly faded to a realization that this hybrid plan was precisely what the Kentucky General Assembly was also suggesting (and would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-general-assembly/2021/03/03/kentucky-school-reopening-bill-senate-education-in-person-learning/6902994002/&quot;&gt;eventually become law thanks to House Bill 208&lt;/a&gt;). It overcame one of the biggest flaws in JCPS’ plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After further debate and comment - including a critical request for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/board-of-education-approves-plan-to-ensure-equitable-return-to-class-for-all-jcps-students/ar-BB1eqMca&quot;&gt;JCPS to put forth an Equity Plan to address achievement gaps&lt;/a&gt; - the Board passed the motion, effectively reopening JCPS to in-person learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect was dramatic - almost immediately you could see elementary families shifting their preferences to in-person school (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiM2M5YjhlYjAtMTBiYi00OTYxLWFkYTYtYWQ3YjM2MWRhNjlhIiwidCI6IjI3N2Q1NjRjLTMwYTktNGJjZS1hMThkLWFmYzhlNTQ1NDBlNSIsImMiOjN9&quot;&gt;live dashboard of preference here&lt;/a&gt;). In LPAS’ case, this has gone from 68% in-person to 80% in-person. Overall, the district has moved from 58% to 64%. Elementary schools have shown the biggest movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The option to have your students stay remote in non-traditional instruction (NTI) was and still remains. That’s where my family was after the February 26th meeting for my students. Only recently did we make the decision to
move our students to in-person, and here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vaccine rollout is moving quickly (and positivity rate is falling)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My wife is now fully vaccinated (as is the majority of my older extended family) &amp;amp; I hope to be fully vaccinated very soon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safety plans have been updated and detailed for both schools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have the ability to drop off and pick up our students from school - avoiding the bus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the virus is being combatted effectively, JCPS finally offered a plan that addresses major risks, and we have the ability to mitigate our personal risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is important to me to not forget that all families are not my family. They do not share our situation or our privileges. Many families are opting to not go back because of lingering risks and their inability to mitigate them. So, as a community that pushed for in-person schooling &lt;em&gt;because of achievement gap concerns&lt;/em&gt;, now’s the time to follow through for those who need it most. (And psst… these gaps didn’t start with the pandemic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Oh no, not more people demanding schools reopen to curb achievement gaps, but then opposing any systemic changes to address the root cause of said gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Olivia Krauth (@oliviakrauth) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/oliviakrauth/status/1369823610660151299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All signs currently point to progress in tamping down the virus and being able to reopen schools with recognized risks mitigated. But it’s not time to stop focusing on safety, schools or achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to be living with the pandemic for the foreseeable future, and fights like what we just had have shown us where our weak spots are. Here on the cusp of reopening, I’m proud of the work that the Board and JCPS teachers and staff put forward to come to this solution, and I’m interested to see where we go from here. Summer and it’s own challenges are right around the corner - and then fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Wilson</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="reopening" /><category term="covid" /><summary type="html">Hybrid schedule, vaccine rollouts and hard work by your schools have changed things in a short few weeks.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">JCPS Reopening: On the Eve of the Vote, I Still Can’t Support It</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-on-the-eve-of-the-vote/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JCPS Reopening: On the Eve of the Vote, I Still Can’t Support It" /><published>2021-02-25T12:25:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-02-25T12:25:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-on-the-eve-of-the-vote</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-on-the-eve-of-the-vote/">&lt;p&gt;After blistering few weeks of back and forth between teachers, families, unions, the Board and JCPS, the JCPS Board of Education is meeting tonight to vote on JCPS Superintendent Dr. Marty Pollio’s recommendation to reopen schools. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/calendar/event/special-meeting-board-education-20&quot;&gt;Click here for details and a link to watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be watching tonight. One of the best ways to follow along in detail is with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/lists/1354430425242988549?s=20&quot;&gt;JCPS School Board &amp;amp; Media Twitter List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before I do, I wanted to make note of the last few weeks of developments, and put down on paper how my thoughts have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what has happened over the last few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Board and its members have ramped up quickly to get a handle around JCPS’ plan and the current science and guidelines. Researching, asking for public comment and scheduling repeated public Q&amp;amp;A and working sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The CDC released new guidelines, the President and Governor Beshear are pushing for schools to reopen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/news/education/voicing-concerns-about-reopening-classrooms-some-jcps-teachers-worried-district-could-become-superspreader/article_3c24230e-7548-11eb-afe4-ff428d653ed0.html&quot;&gt;largest teacher union in Jefferson County (JCTA) released the results of a survey of its members&lt;/a&gt;, revealing a 58% majority that do not want schools to reopen, largely because they do not feel that JCPS’ efforts are up to snuff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JCPS has hurriedly reacted to this feedback, updating its plans and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wfpl.org/jcps-will-struggle-with-social-distancing-even-with-some-staying-remote/&quot;&gt;finally publicly acknowledging parent and teacher concerns and the gaps it will not be able to fully fill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individual schools, meanwhile, have been detailing their custom reopening plans and communicating them to teachers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wfpl.org/ky-house-oks-bill-requiring-schools-to-open-in-person-by-late-march/&quot;&gt;Kentucky State House of Representatives approved HB 208&lt;/a&gt; which, if approved by the General Assembly, would force JCPS to reopen March 29th regardless of the Board’s decision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wymt.com/2021/02/25/kea-shares-frustrations-with-us-dept-of-education-standardized-testing-decision/&quot;&gt;US Department of Education is requiring standardized testing to happen by end of school year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot to take in. The net result over the past few weeks is that the vacuum of leadership and communication has begun to be filled, and some of the concerns that teachers and families have have been met. But in my estimation it’s still risky, and it may be a massive effort for little effect. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-jcps-still-cannot-provide-adequate-social-distancing-in-classrooms-or-on-buses&quot;&gt;1. JCPS still cannot provide adequate social distancing in classrooms or on buses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a concern from day one among teachers and families - though it was not publicly acknowledged until only recently. A realization was also made (perhaps &lt;em&gt;during a board meeting&lt;/em&gt;) that this problem will only be exacerbated as more and more families are comfortable with coming back to school. At LPAS - we currently have nearly 70% of students returning. That equates to an &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; of 20 students per classroom. 
It can’t be done, and it’s what the CDC is recommending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said - public health officials from both state and local agencies are pushing for reopening as “safe”. Various mitigation layers in the plan and vaccinating teachers is rightfully driving that, but the majority of families (and no children) will be NOT vaccinated soon. So while from a community perspective we might be “safe”, there is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; individual risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that vaccine appears to be showing dramatic effect and positive information around transmissability is showing up every day. In addition, the JCTA worked with JCPS to clarify (shockingly late, I might add) rules around accomodations for teachers who are at-risk or who are also caregivers. This included reserving some 200 vaccines for the family members of teachers who are at-risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-the-burden-on-schools-is-high-and-getting-higher-the-disruption-is-likely-to-be-intense&quot;&gt;2. The burden on schools is high and getting higher. The disruption is likely to be intense.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With school administration detailing plans and communicated to teachers &lt;em&gt;as we speak&lt;/em&gt;, it’s becoming clearer that the effort it will take to reopen under this plan is immense. Non-teachers will be pressed into instructional roles, and mitigation efforts throughout the day will be shared by all in the school (administration and counselors assisting in cleanup, policing kids during entry and exit, etc). This will lead to a decline in instructional time and quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, with the split option of NTI and in-person, student/teacher assignments are very likely to be upset. The NTI teacher your students have had throughout the year will likely change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have received assurances from both of the schools where I have students that everything in their power is being done (at a sprint) to comply with guidelines and lessen disruptions. But both schools have indicated that it’s going to be a huge challenge and they have concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-this-massive-effort-buys-us-little-quality-instructional-time&quot;&gt;3. This massive effort buys us little quality instructional time.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this effort will buy us - at most - 9 weeks of school at the elementary and middle level. 7 at the high school level. For elementary, that’s 45 days of in-person learning. For middle and high schools (who will be on a weekly hybrid schedule of remote and in-person learning) that’s 14 to 18 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Reopening dates depend on grade level. Here&amp;#39;s the proposed line-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;— K-2nd return March 17&lt;br /&gt;— 3rd-5th return March 18&lt;br /&gt;— Early childhood return March 22&lt;br /&gt;— Middle and high return April 5&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Olivia Krauth (@oliviakrauth) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/oliviakrauth/status/1365001096318517248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus - the Department of Education recently announced it is requiring standardized testing - so a considerable amount of precious instructional time will be given over to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counterpoint here is that mental health and community / economic impact from schools not being open is real. But at what risk and cost to schools and teachers are we willing to take on to achieve a &lt;em&gt;short term&lt;/em&gt; impact? It feels very high to me - and we have not heard a peep about critical summer programs or the fall semester yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally - if student achievement or the wellbeing of the most in-need students was really what was driving this - why did we not get &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; into schools (safely) first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I wonder why our reopening plans don&amp;#39;t include a way to identify those students, reach out to those families and get them back into the buildings first? This way we can (1) get kids caught up who have fallen behind, (2) practice/perfect the districts COVID protocols,&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Corrie Shull (@corrieshull) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/corrieshull/status/1364725900361797634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still feel that to attempt a half-measure right now is just not worth it, and worse, it’s still unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking about this as JCPS attempting to land an airplane on the last 10 feet of runway, where the runway is the rapidly closing 2020-2021 school year. You could do it, but at what effort and what risk? Just go around, plan a better landing for the fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; confidence that the administration, teachers and staff at my two schools (LPAS Elementary and Noe Middle) are going to do everything in their power to safely and effectively get kids back learning in school. But they are unfairly bearing the brunt and the burden because JCPS didn’t. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/columnists/gerth/2021/02/24/amid-covid-jcps-leaders-need-better-plan-get-kids-back-class/4572516001/&quot;&gt;Joe Gerth’s Op-Ed piece in the CJ “Don’t blame teachers. JCPS brass is responsible for getting kids in school safely”&lt;/a&gt; says all this better than I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was on the Board, I would vote no and would immediately start pressing for immediate focus on those most in-need and at-risk as well as planning for 100% in-person summer programs and the fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Wilson</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="reopening" /><category term="covid" /><summary type="html">A massive effort, considerable disruption, unknown risk all for little gain.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">JCPS Reopening: A Lot of Communication Issues Coming to a Head, No Vote In Sight Yet</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-a-lot-of-communication-issues-coming-to-a-head/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JCPS Reopening: A Lot of Communication Issues Coming to a Head, No Vote In Sight Yet" /><published>2021-02-22T23:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-02-22T23:30:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-a-lot-of-communication-issues-coming-to-a-head</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-a-lot-of-communication-issues-coming-to-a-head/">&lt;p&gt;It’s February 23rd, and we are still awaiting a recommendation from Superintendent Dr. Pollio on reopening JCPS to in-person schooling. What seemed like an inevitability only a couple of weeks ago now appears to have been stopped in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might assume that with new CDC guidelines, the weight of the Presidency and vaccines behind reopening, this would be a slam-dunk, right? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should have been, except that JCPS has failed until just recently to substantively listen to it’s two main bodies: the teachers and the families of students. It’s possible they have been listening and just not said anything - but that doesn’t explain the sudden about-face on a vote on reopening. What does explain it is the tide of feedback from teachers and families (in addition to the newly released CDC guidance) swamping JCPS’ rushed attempt to reopen schools in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, there is not currently a date set for reopening or a vote by the board to reopen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do, however, have another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJCC8xo7s9vxfFZiV5ZoocQ&quot;&gt;JCPS Board “Working Session” with medical experts to discuss CDC Guidelines tomorrow, February 23rd at 6PM on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;INBOX: The Jefferson County Board of Ed is meeting tomorrow night to discuss the reopening plan and the newest CDC guidelines with a group of medical professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will NOT be a vote tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jess Clark (@jess_m_clark) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jess_m_clark/status/1363967240236843012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jefferson County Teacher’s Associaton (JCTA) survey that was delivered Friday, February 12th, days before Dr. Pollio’s anticipated recommendation to reopen schools. After weeks of near-zero communication between JCPS and teachers, JCPS got an earful. 58% of teacheers said “no” to returning. There were “400 pages” of comment attached, according to the CJ’s Olivia Krauth. These concerns ran the gambit from student safety to the safety of teachers’ families at home, to employment and school function concerns. (Read more coverage of the JCTA survey from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/news/education/voicing-concerns-about-reopening-classrooms-some-jcps-teachers-worried-district-could-become-superspreader/article_3c24230e-7548-11eb-afe4-ff428d653ed0.html&quot;&gt;WDRB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2021/02/18/kentucky-teachers-got-vaccine-why-some-schools-arent-reopened-yet/6763680002/&quot;&gt;the CJ&lt;/a&gt;) By the following Monday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/in-depth/jcps-teachers-union-strike-deal-on-classroom-reopening-strategy/article_18ea7332-6fc8-11eb-8924-37b38f763427.html&quot;&gt;JCPS and JCTA had struck a deal on reopening&lt;/a&gt;. The recommendation was put off indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the next &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EYqUDT61kI&quot;&gt;JCPS Board Meeting on Tuesday February 16th&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Pollio characterized the responses from teachers  as “a lot of communication issues”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that same Board Meeting, the JCPS Board levied some of it’s most direct and focused questions to Dr. Pollio and the JCPS administration in attendance. It was welcome and representative of their increased focus and dedication to this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since late January, the Jefferson County School Board has been responding to increasing intense public pressure. Scrolling back through &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/lists/1354430425242988549?s=20&quot;&gt;the increasingly active Twitter feeds of board members&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJCC8xo7s9vxfFZiV5ZoocQ&quot;&gt;watching the (now weekly) board meetings on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the Board finally get on top of a conflict they did not really want to or were prepared to have to adjudicate. Their increasingly critical, increasingly focused questioning - fueled by the concerns of teachers and families - have made it clear to JCPS that the Board isn’t ready to support reopening until concerns are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - where does that leave us now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you remember, way back two weeks ago, Dr. Pollio said that we could be ready to reopen as early as mid-March. That appears unlikely now as tomorrow the JCPS Board of Education is hosting another “Working Session” with medical experts to discuss the CDC Guidelines with NO VOTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that some of the teacher’s concerns were met in the deal struck, and JCPS is increasing its detailed communication to teachers and parents (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xszvv3PzVg&quot;&gt;watch the February 18 Town Hall Meeting that featured questions from JCPS families&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some concerns - like social distancing - that are unlikely for JCPS to overcome for those concerned. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EYqUDT61kI&amp;amp;t=4565s&quot;&gt;See this exchange between Dr. Corrie Shull and Dr. Pollio from the 2/16 meeting&lt;/a&gt;). It will take some change in JCPS accomodations, some change in the pandemic for this to be overcome. The former is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/in-depth/some-jcps-employees-struggling-to-schedule-covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots/article_9390128c-7558-11eb-b2cc-53520bdcd3eb.html&quot;&gt;some JCPS teachers are struggling to scheddule vaccine booster shots&lt;/a&gt;, and detailed individual reopening plans have not been finalized by schools or communicated to teachers. I know these plans, which include details like “which teacher will my student be assigned” are being actively, hurriedly worked on in the two schools where I have students. I’m sure teachers will have plenty of questions - as will families when they are eventually communicated by the schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leaves us here - only 3 months to the end of the regular school year. Charitably, we could get elementary and middle schools back in late March, leaving two months, less Spring Break. Middle and high schools would operate on a hybrid schedule of remote and in-person school, meaning even fewer “in person” days for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the US Department of Education wants schools to complete standardized testing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This could mean Kentucky&amp;#39;s largest district will spend a significant portion of its few potential in-person instruction days proctoring standardized tests. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bF7r2F0tAA&quot;&gt;https://t.co/bF7r2F0tAA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Olivia Krauth (@oliviakrauth) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/oliviakrauth/status/1364000176650747904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two students won’t be returning to school in-person this year largely because I don’t believe that JCPS can effectively mitigate the spread of COVID through social distancing, but also because I don’t believe that (&lt;a href=&quot;https://benwilson.org/sbdm/statements/statement-against-reopening-jcps-for-in-person-school/&quot;&gt;and haven’t believed&lt;/a&gt;) that reopening for this short amount of time is worth the massive effort and disruption required. Let’s get people vaccinated and then reopen with quality in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

Below are my notes from the February 16th 2021 LPAS SBDM meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I’m one of two parent reprensentatives, so my notes are slanted towards parent/family topics. As far as notes go, they are probably incomplete, and are definitely not “official”. Official agendas and approved minutes are posted on the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lincoln.jefferson.kyschools.us/groups/14915/site_based_decision_making_council_sbdm/sbdm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;LPAS SBDM page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sppublic.jefferson.kyschools.us/sbdm/SitePages/Home.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;JCPS SBDM Council and Standing Committee Minutes site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-news&quot;&gt;Good News&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Playground equipment is now complete. Thank you PTA!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shoutout to Ms. Jones for her Minecraft Clubs!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also: Student Spotlight is a hit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://lincoln.jefferson.kyschools.us/groups/14915/site_based_decision_making_council_sbdm/sbdm&quot;&gt;LPAS SBDM page&lt;/a&gt; has been updated with all dates and easy links to Agendas and Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;committee-reports&quot;&gt;Committee Reports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much on comittee reports - admins have been asked to focus on back to school planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSIP Survey&lt;/strong&gt; may move to the fall. If done in spring it will be abbreviated. Ms. Case hopes it happens in the fall during “back to school” so it won’t be affected by NTI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backpack of Success&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are interested in reviewing Backpacks, you can do so! (I’m waiting to get a link for this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racial Equity&lt;/strong&gt; is continuing with staff discussions of “So You Want to Talk About Race”. “A lot of good questions and conversations happening” and that she is seeing a lot of teachers relating it to real-world classroom situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staffing&quot;&gt;Staffing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome Frank Goodlow - our new attendance clerk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first grade teaching position has been open since the beginning of the year. Since it was beyond the “transfer period” they are currently in the lookback process, school must interview 8 people, including the person currently in the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, one of our  4th/5th split teachers has resigned last week, and Ms. Case has reached out to all families of students affected. Hiring freeze coming up in March. There will be a sub remainder of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: See below for an update for ESL teaching related to budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;student-achievement-updates&quot;&gt;Student Achievement Updates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;732 books read last week “They are reading!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;budget&quot;&gt;Budget&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of movement since school isn’t spending money. LPAS spent money on school supplies (non-COVID-related) earlier in the year. They are working on having “individual schools supplies” for a return to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Budget due March 15th, one day prior to our regular March meeting. So the week of 8th we will hold an early special meeting. Ms. Case will provide a “narrative” on the budget so that Council members do not need to parse line-by-line each budget item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to LPAS’ relatively low ESL (English as a Second Language) student-teacher ratio (“roughly half compared to the rest of the district” per Mr. Evans), and the way that LPAS is lottery-assigned students, we will be losing one of the three ESL staff we currently have. In short - under prior non-lottery student assignement plans, LPAS and JCPS had more control over the number of ESL students who were admitted. With a random lottery, the demographics are a random sampling of applicants, so staffing related to those demographics will also change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-review&quot;&gt;Policy Review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we recently completed a principal selection, our &lt;strong&gt;Principal Selection Policy was reviewed&lt;/strong&gt;. Most Council members agreed that the policy and the process was not in need of major change, as the process went smoothly. However, we did receive some pointed feedback from the school community regarding the makeup of the Interview Committee (which is the Council itself, excluding the existing principal, plus “three additional members” chosen by Council). Our policy states that the Council “will ensure a diverse representation.” The Council felt that we did this well during our last process, choosing a Committee that was diverse in race, gender, administration vs teacher, arts vs traditional. However, we agreed that as a magnet, this can be tough requirement to fill. Should we expand this to more than three? Should we require “arts” and “administration” (e.g. a counselor)? We are getting feedback from the district in regards to that. We’ll have feedback on that ahead of the second reading next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JCPS has also asked us to &lt;strong&gt;consider adding “Policy Waivers” to our Bylaws&lt;/strong&gt;. This would allow “in extenuating circumstances” a Council to waive Council policies for a period of time. The practical guidance from JCPS has pretty light here - but we were made to understand this was allow Councils to respond to COVID-like events. As an example: suspending the “Dress Code Policy” due to everyone being remote. The example language stated that “by majority vote” a Council could waive a policy for an amount of time, and they could do so within the span of a single meeting, instead of the two meetings required by SBDM rules. I felt like this was a dramatic power to hand to a Council (or the majority of a Council), so we should definitely put limits to it. So, I suggested a couple of things: 1) that it be larger than a majority 2) there be limits to the length of a waiver. Mr. Evans suggested that instead of those things that waivers would need to be reviewed and extended month to month. That seems simple and fair, and we are set to do another reading of this next month (possibly after we seek guidance from our JCPS SBDM liasion)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;old-business&quot;&gt;Old Business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the Principal Selection documents (council statement, survey results, etc) have been linked in the December 15, 2020 meeting minutes which you can now find through the &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; SBDM Minutes link on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/155o-OecxAQ_K7wRhO5uX-FqTmXhzyYS1&quot;&gt;LPAS SBDM Page&lt;/a&gt; - officially closing out that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Ms. Case mentioned that she will be changing up the SBDM Policies link “over the summer” to link to individual policies. Currently it’s one big, non-searchable PDF of all the policies (though they are in alphabetical order).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-business-aka-reopening&quot;&gt;New Business AKA Reopening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I hadn’t expected to be discussing LPAS’ reopening plans this evening (it’s not really in SBDM’s purview) - Ms. Case did state that LPAS has been working on their reopening plan, offered details and answered a number of questions from both parents and teacher representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was very welcome - as I mentioned later to Ms. Case, the amount of official communication from LPAS or JCPS to parents has been &lt;em&gt;minimal&lt;/em&gt;, while the amount of questions, concerns and private chatter regarding reopening is &lt;em&gt;voluminous&lt;/em&gt;. Whatever she or JCPS can do to communicate with parents would be appreciated, and would go a long way to tamping down speculation and setting expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of detail, and I’m going to miss much of it, but here are my notes around the conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ms. Roth asked what is the current percentage of students expected to return to LPAS. Currently it is 70% in-person, 30% remote. (FYI JCPS is publishing those states in real(?) time &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiM2M5YjhlYjAtMTBiYi00OTYxLWFkYTYtYWQ3YjM2MWRhNjlhIiwidCI6IjI3N2Q1NjRjLTMwYTktNGJjZS1hMThkLWFmYzhlNTQ1NDBlNSIsImMiOjN9&quot;&gt;here, for each school&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;70% equates to roughly 20 students per classroom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ms. Case offered this assessment of just how many students LPAS can safely handle by saying that “if we go from 68% to 83%” LPAS could not do that - they don’t have the space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LPAS’ reopening plan is due for presentation &lt;em&gt;to staff&lt;/em&gt; by the end of next week (2/26). (Note: Dr. Pollio said later that evening that ‘the third week of March’ would be the earliest elementary would reopen)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are attempting to effect all mitigation efforts possible. For example, all round “preschool” tables are being removed in favor of solo, front-facing desks (“kids facing one another is a ‘big no-no’”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ms. Craven asked about how student “Choices” (arts electives) in 4th/5th grade would affect contact tracing/cohorting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Band and Chorus &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; continue. “They can play for 30 minutes”. When I asked, Ms. Case stated that they are following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kmea.org/home/covid-19-resources-for-music-educators/&quot;&gt;NAfME/KMEA protocols&lt;/a&gt; and she was familiar with these from her prior role at YPAS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Per Ms. Case, classrooms that have different groups of students shuttling in/out (e.g. Dance) will end 5 minutes early and staff will work to disinfect the rooms. Ms. Case stated that staff includes the teacher, the principal, counselors, whomever they have.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teachers who “have a need” to be virtual, LPAS is going to try to make them virtual-only teachers, housing them solo in the building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Case did not offer her opinion on reopening, but did note that the high percentage of students returning to in-person school at LPAS does put them in very clear jeopardy of running afoul of CDC social distancing guidelines. “It’s a double-edged sword”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share her concerns and I think the JCPS Board and teachers do as well, hence the delay of a recommendation. There are real, physical limitations to JCPS’ ability to hit the CDC guidelines. So either we reopen and fudge those guidelines or… the buildings get bigger and buses aren’t used? (On buses, Ms. Case noted that that is not the responsbility of the individual schools, but rather JCPS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those concerns and challenges aside - I feel confident that the staff at LPAS is preparing as best they can for what appears to be an imminent return to in-person school. It’s a whirlwind of shifting guidelines, science and recommendations, and it’s largely out of individual school control. But they can plan and prep, and so they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the candor and transparency in her remarks - and I hope we will hear more soon. As a reminder, JCPS is hosting a Virtual Town Hall, Thursday, February 18 at 6PM to discuss reopening. You can watch it live on &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/jcpsweb&quot;&gt;youtube.com/jcpsweb&lt;/a&gt; and they will be providing a “text line…for you to text in your questions”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in March!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Wilson</name></author><category term="meetingnotes" /><category term="sbdm" /><summary type="html">SBDM Standing Meeting from Tuesday, February 16 2021.

It’s expected that Dr. Pollio will recommend to reopen schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teachers that I have spoken to are largely in the same boat as other JCPS families - attempting to take in all of the information and make an informed risk assessment, with minimal communication or acknowledgement of concerns. Frustration and confusion among those with concerns, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into this confusion and charged atmosphere comes the recently released CDC guidelines and the “growing body of evidence” that schools can be reopened safely - which is sure to swing public opinion further towards reopening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://benwilson.org/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-cdc-guidelines-nyt-survey/&quot;&gt;my post yesterday&lt;/a&gt; - this information &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; made me more confident that from a community perspective, we can safely reopen, and we should because the benefit is higher than the aggregate risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But - and this &lt;em&gt;will be the point of friction in the coming weeks&lt;/em&gt; - while the risk for the community is lower, we are transferring risks to already burdened teachers, staff and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are asking teachers and staff to take on individual risks that they have been ill-informed to assess and ill-equipped to handle. Worse, from the telling nature of the questions I have heard from teach friends (especially those with at-risk family members) they have not been granted an opportunity to have their concerns addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: only today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cmkolb/status/1361022326746329091?s=20&quot;&gt;Board Member Chris Kolb shed light on concerns around teachers with at-risk family members or risk factors themselves&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC Guidelines suggest “temporary reassignment” for these teachers. By my accounting, JCPS’ guidelines there have been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the likes of Mr. Kolb (himself not an educator by trade) there are many JCPS Board members who are educators, and they have expressed concerns similar to this. “How will social distancing be possible?” “How will it be enforced?” “What is the risk of taking COVID home to my family?” “What are the quarantine protocols?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teachers I know are invested and involved, so I doubt seriously that this is merely teachers “not paying attention”. Given the lack of detailed communication from JCPS to families, I tend to assume this is the case for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is going to be a very contentious, fast-moving few weeks if the recommendation to reopen comes down. I honestly don’t know how the Board will vote - but from recent responses from Board members and the new guidelines - I suspect they’ll pass it with reservations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will leave JCPS steaming towards reopening (as early as March 17th), with concerned teachers and their union standing in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an unfortunately contentious position for teachers. It will likely elicit responses from the public akin to “take one for the team, like other frontline workers”. But, as a friend put it - “while teacher’s unions are in the spotlight right now, it is only because unions have been decimated in other sectors … front-line retail, grocery, restaurant, and other service industry workers haven’t forced a work stoppage on a national scale” - not because they don’t have concerns, but because they don’t have the leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers, however, do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a public fight over reopening, it won’t be the teachers’ fault. They have real, legitimate concerns, and have been classically underpayed and overburdened. It’s a conversation and a negotiation that should have happened many, many months ago. Ultimately, it’s a conversation that unless addressed now, will rear its head at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you value educators, I’d suggest considering their concerns and the burdens we are (as a community) asking them to take (without a change in compensation).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Wilson</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="reopening" /><category term="covid" /></entry><entry><title type="html">JCPS Reopening: CDC Guidelines and NYT Disease Expert Survey Bring Much Needed Leadership and Clarity</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-cdc-guidelines-nyt-survey/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JCPS Reopening: CDC Guidelines and NYT Disease Expert Survey Bring Much Needed Leadership and Clarity" /><published>2021-02-13T12:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-02-13T12:30:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-cdc-guidelines-nyt-survey</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-cdc-guidelines-nyt-survey/">&lt;p&gt;Things changed for me yesterday. The CDC’s “comprehensive science-based plan” for school reopening, and a New York Times survey of 175 pediatric disease specialists regarding what is important for reopening. Both strongly indicate that we can and should reopen schools, and they do so from a place of science and concensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my concerns about reopening from the community’s perspective is lessened with these two things - my concerns about JCPS’ ability to adhere to them and the pursuant risks still present for teachers and families are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With clarity from leadership and science present, the work to close the gaps and address family issues is much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NPR: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/02/12/967033554/cdc-offers-clearest-guidance-yet-for-reopening-schools&quot;&gt;CDC Offers Clearest Guidance Yet For Reopening Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NYT:&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/upshot/schools-reopening-coronavirus-experts.html?referringSource=articleShare&quot;&gt;We Asked 175 Pediatric Disease Experts if It Was Safe Enough to Open School&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;I’ve also uploaded a &lt;a href=&quot;/sbdm/assets/We%20Asked%20175%20Pediatric%20Disease%20Experts%20if%20It%20Was%20Safe%20Enough%20to%20Open%20School%20-%20The%20New%20York%20Times.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDC guidelines are similar to those in the past, but with notable revelations. The survey, conducted prior to the release of the guidelines, echo the guidelines. The two together provide for me two things lacking from prior conversation: science-based priorities and critical risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;86% of the experts polled feel that safely reopening schools &lt;strong&gt;with masking and social distancing&lt;/strong&gt; is not only possible, it’s advised.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Although these experts specialized in children’s physical health, many concluded that the risks to mental health, social skills and education outweighed the risks of the virus.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Masks and social distancing ranked clear #1 and #2 most critical efforts to be made.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vaccines for teachers (or students) are not considered critical by the guidelines or the disease experts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community infection rate is not as high a priority as previously considered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, these clear definitions of priority and risk assessments largely settle the arguments swirling around at every level (personal, local, state, federal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/monicagandhi9/status/1360678712010678273?s=21&quot;&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katetaylornyt/status/1360325042014404611?s=21&quot;&gt;including the senior author of the Wisconsin schools study&lt;/a&gt; believes the CDCs guidelines are &lt;em&gt;too restrictive&lt;/em&gt;. Their criticisms appear to align with the results of the survey.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding JCPS - vaccination of teachers and community infection rates are two things that have been widely adopted as critcal by local officials, unions and parent groups. This is clear guidance that - at a community level - they are not as critical to “safely reopening”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-feel-confident-in-their-assessment-that-at-a-community-level-reopening-can-be-done-safely-but&quot;&gt;I feel confident in their assessment that at a community level reopening can be done safely. But…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… neither the CDC guidelines nor this survey relieve JCPS from the challenges that their plan will continue to have with social distancing, or the concerns from individual teachers and families. I do feel that these guidelines and reports provide clearer priorities for the critical discussions and negotiations those parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the survey report highlighted: &lt;em&gt;“Just because school opening isn’t causing higher levels of community transmission doesn’t mean that there isn’t individual risk to teachers and staff”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have been at near-zero risk for contracting or spreading the disease for nearly a year having had the privlege of working from home and doing everything I can to not catch or spread the virus. With school reopening, the risk to my family - especially if JCPS cannot mitigate the gaps in their planning - essentially triples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For teachers with families, many of whom who have been at home like me, this increase in risk is even higher, and so far without much acknowledgement (or compensation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concerns about JCPS’ ability to enforce masking (the #1 most important prevention factor) and social distancing (#2) are still here, and are very real. As the NPR article mentions: &lt;em&gt;“mask use dropped precipitously elsewhere, from just 42% on school buses and 40% in restrooms to 36% in the cafeteria”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, JCPS Superintendent Dr. Marty Pollio is formulating his recommendation that will be provided to the JCPS Board of Education at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/about/leadership/board-education&quot;&gt;the next public meeting on Tuesday, February 16th at 6PM&lt;/a&gt;. Note: They will not vote that day, but at “a later date”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there will remain concerns, the skies are finally lightening with science and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is that with this information and further guidance, JCPS can mitigate the gaps in the planning and the various concerns with families and teachers to get back to in-person school. That’s the work that will get us back into school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must not forget that there are still those that are vulnerable outside the walls of the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I am still hesistant to send my children back to school until my wife and I are vaccinated, and I am concerned for those teachers who are in the same spot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Wilson</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="reopening" /><category term="covid" /><summary type="html">New CDC Guidelines and a New York Times survey of 175 pediatrics disease specialists brings leadership and clarity to the work of reopening.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">JCPS Reopening: Updates from February 9th Plan Discussion</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-updates-from-feb-9th-meeting/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JCPS Reopening: Updates from February 9th Plan Discussion" /><published>2021-02-10T08:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-02-10T08:30:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-updates-from-feb-9th-meeting</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sbdm/updates/jcps-reopening-updates-from-feb-9th-meeting/">&lt;p&gt;On February 9th 2021, the Jefferson County Board of Education held a special meeting - a “working session” - to present and discuss in detail JCPS’ reopening plans, and how those plans would be executed at individual schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A recommendation from Dr. Pollio is to come next week, 2/16. The Board will vote later. The earliest reopening date is currently March 17th, due to vaccine availibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the JCPS Superintendent Dr. Pollio and the sitting Board members, a laundry list of other JCPS officials including a selection of principals at all grade levels, were in attendance to present the JCPS plans, discuss their individual school plans, and to answer questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those following reopening and the overall &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/planning-jcps-reopening&quot;&gt;JCPS plans and guidelines for reopening&lt;/a&gt; - there was little new in the reading of the plans. However, it did present an opportunity to showcase the amount of work, detail and care that individual schools are doing to comply with JCPS’ guidelines. The work is happening, and it’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. It will also be a lot on the day to day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the meeting was reserved for each board member, 15 minutes at a time, to question those present. Compared to the February 2nd meeting - tonight there was a notable difference in the Board’s push to have detailed answers about gaps, risks and what JCPS plans to do to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Chairman Diane Porter’s final statements summed it up well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…the board deserves to have that information and have facts and figures before we are asked to make a vote that is serious as this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of Louisville’s education reporters, Olivia Krauth from the CJ, Jess Clark from WFPL and Kevin Wheatley from WDRB were live-tweeting the meeting last night. It’s a great way to catch up, if you don’t have time to watch the 2 1/2 hour YouTube below:&lt;/p&gt;

Public encouraged to offer comment via email)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where I’m currently at on reopening for the remainder of this school year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don’t support it, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we are being told that we must reopen in-person, there continues to be a lack of evidence being offered from public health and JCPS officials that we can safely do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I am seeing a disturbing there is a lack of acknowledgement about the risks teachers and families are being asked to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to put it into a metaphor, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a big wave coming, and it’s gonna hit the beach. Most folks in power have their back turned to it. The first people it’ll hit, though, are JCPS teachers and their families.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reopening is going to happen - and frankly, needs to happen - but when and under what circumstances is the current debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attitude that I read from officials is that this choice has been made for them and that it is inevitable, and we are to move forward at all costs. Costs that even our own public health officials cannot claim to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this decision moves forward and is wrong, those directly in the path of it are teachers and their families. Yes, COVID affects the whole community, but teachers are not being given the same option of in-person or NTI teaching, effectively making the choise between their health and their jobs - a choice they did not sign up for. And worse these teachers being made scapegoats for having the same concerns we all share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of of this stems from a lack of leadership at the federal level - which if &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/video/biden-calls-covid-pandemics-impact-on-women-a-national-emergency/&quot;&gt;today’s announcement holds true will be addressed somewhat by President Biden’s approval of CDC guideliens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But - the federal government does not make JCPS decisions. Those at the state and city level will make the decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-has-changed&quot;&gt;So What Has Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/sbdm/statements/statement-against-reopening-jcps-for-in-person-school/&quot;&gt;Since I last wrote about it&lt;/a&gt; - nothing has changed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/planning-jcps-reopening&quot;&gt;JCPS plans and guidelines for reopening&lt;/a&gt;. There are still considerable, concerning gaps and unfair treatment of teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; changed is that the public conversation around this has grown louder. Superintendent Pollio and public health officials are responding, and the risks teachers are being asked to take are coming into sharper relief. All in all, there is mounting public pressure - especially on teachers and their unions - to return to in-person school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wave3.com/2021/02/04/mcconnell-jcps-vice-chairman-clash-over-issue-reopening-schools/&quot;&gt;Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell&lt;/a&gt; who openly chastized JCPS Board vice-chair Chris Kolb after he voiced the concerns of teachers. This is ignorant, unfair and unbecoming of a man of McConnell’s stature - but on par for his political record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I digress. A decision from the Board rapidly approaching and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/in-depth/jcps-teachers-support-staff-unions-polling-members-on-reopening-classrooms/article_63146ae8-67cc-11eb-bced-3340d4ebdc32.html&quot;&gt;the largest teachers union in JCPS are taking a poll of their members regarding reopening&lt;/a&gt;. So this &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be coming to a head, and soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that JCPS is on track to have all teachers vaccinated fully by early March (lord willin’ and we get the second round of vaccine doses!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-poor-argument-for-reopening&quot;&gt;A Poor Argument for Reopening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the local and state defense of reopening - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMJUU6hBUAo&quot;&gt;the most recent JCPS Board of Education meeting (February 2, 2021)&lt;/a&gt; featured a marathon 3-hour question-and-answer session with &lt;a href=&quot;https://louisvilleky.gov/government/health-wellness/dr-sarah-moyer-chief-health-strategist]&quot;&gt;Dr. Sara Moyer, Chief Health Strategist&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. Connie White from the Kentucky Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns and tensions were high, Board members were prepared, and the answers from Drs. Moyer and White were thorough and lengthy. But I would characterize the responses on the whole as heavily favoring reopening, supported with little evidence, failing to acknowledge the known risks and without adequately addressing the detailed concerns of the Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears as though local and state public health officials are resigned to reopening and are working to support an incredibly shaky defense while not acknowledging areas of CDC guidance that JCPS can’t achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It pains me great to hear what I heard, but it’s there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three response from that conversation stuck out to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WMJUU6hBUAo?t=2730&quot;&gt;exchange between Mr. Craig and Dr. Moyers&lt;/a&gt; around mental health issues that begun by floating “anecdotal evidence” of “waiting lists at psychiatric hospitals” and culminated with Dr. Moyers saying “I think [the claimed data] is what drove the state’s decision to vaccinate K-12 teachers” . She furthered this with a claim that overdoses and homicides were on the rise in children. When I reached out to Dr. Kolb, he told me this data was requested but has not been provided.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WMJUU6hBUAo?t=5702&quot;&gt;response to Rev. Shull statement “basically we don’t know whether or not vaccinated teachers can take it home to their families”&lt;/a&gt; should have been a simple “no, we don’t”. Instead, it was a carefully worded response that equated teachers to front-line healthcare workers and “the majority of them never brought it home”. Teachers heard the risk in these words.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WDRB reported “While she could not provide specific data, Dr. White said youth suicide attempts have increased in Kentucky recently.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/in-depth/city-state-health-officials-say-jcps-can-safely-reopen-as-school-board-decision-looms/article_dd0920dc-65d3-11eb-8f77-db9e5f35daa8.html&quot;&gt;WDRB, Feb 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, she &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WMJUU6hBUAo?t=2380&quot;&gt;referred to UV and air filters as “voodoo”&lt;/a&gt; after a lengthy discussion around the need for airflow and then went on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WMJUU6hBUAo?t=2604&quot;&gt;lean on her home improvement experiences&lt;/a&gt; to make an argument that “old buildings breath better”. Both things she admitted are not her area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a scientist or a public health expert but I was taught (in JCPS) that anecdotes are not evidence and correlation is not causation. If you don’t know the answer or don’t have data, you don’t claim it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I was not convinced because I didn’t think these public health officials were entirely convinced.  This leaves me feeling the argument here was weak and possibly influenced by forces outside of their control (see the wave metaphor above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you personally read the responses in that meeting, the summary is this: &lt;em&gt;Our local and state public health officials consider the threat to mental health as far larger than the impact of COVID, when it comes to reopening schools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that they feel that less harm will come from the total effects of COVID - physical, mental, economic - if we reopen schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backing this decision is years of professional experience but woefully little data - which you can’t blame them for. COVID illnesses is easy to meausre in the short term. Mental health and other long-term effects are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest and up-front about this. It’s OK. We want scientist to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-the-concerns-still-here&quot;&gt;Are the concerns still here?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the gaps are still here - even with the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing body of US and European studies(1) - including the guidance from the CDC still say safely reopening schools rely upon things like social distancing &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;, airflow and a detailed approach. President Biden made it clear tonight that two of my biggest concerns with reopening - social distancing in classrooms and on buses - will be a part of the CDC guidance they are expected to push this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the response from JCPS and public health officials I heard did not even acknowledge those as requirements. It was instead a consistent refrain was that “every precaution” was being made, and that safety was “like stacks of swiss cheese”. But there are real, serious gaps, the CDC knows it and the President is likely to back it. On packed buses and crowded, stuffy classrooms with windows that won’t open and doors that the state says you can’t open. And let’s not forget that the community itself is complicit in the success or failure. We are “in the red zone”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, and with these gaps, there are risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-in--on-reopening&quot;&gt;Closing in … on Reopening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gaps aren’t being closed. The risks are not being acknowledged. Teachers and their families - and therefore the whole community - is possibly being put at great risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to trust Dr. Moyers and Dr. White. They have real experience and knowledge and have access to data and resources we do not. That’s a cornerstone of public trust. But when you offer no evidence and couple it with not addressing or worse - brushing aside - real, black-and-white concerns, it erodes that trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what’s behind it exactly. These people of science appear to be brushing aside what many in the community see as real, demonstrable risk. I assume they, too, are caught up in the coming wave. Vaccines have been allotted. Teachers have been given the shot. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a real mental health crisis right now. There is also a real pandemic that uses our whole community as its network to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, if the data is to be believed, I and many others think we can’t reopen safely by the measures available to us. Do we want to? Definitely. But somewhere, the risk assessment has been made that these real risks are worth reopening and possibly spreading the disease further. But the evidence for it hasn’t been shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressure continues to mount.  This is failure from the top-down, and it’s falling on the schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m disappointed in that lack of leadership - but hopeful with President Biden’s announcement today that that will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I still can’t support reopening from March-June 2021 until JCPS and the community take the risks more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after all that - I am hopeful that after we’ve vaccinated enough people to bring our infection rate down, and the gaps we have in our reopening plan have been mitigated, we will be able to safely reopen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimistically, I hope that means the fall term at the latest. I’d love for it to be this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime - wear a mask, get tested if you have to be in contact with others, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kycovid19.ky.gov/&quot;&gt;keep an eye out when you or your loved ones are eligible for the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/about/leadership/board-education&quot;&gt;next Jefferson County Board of Education meeting is slated for February 16th at 6PM&lt;/a&gt;. If you have concerns or questions, review the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/planning-jcps-reopening&quot;&gt;JCPS Reopening Plans&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t already, and contact the Board to have your voice heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emails for the current JCPS School Board are here:

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Louisville is not the only city struggling with reopening. In this article from the New York Times, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/us/schools-reopening-teachers-unions.html?referrer=masthead&quot;&gt;The Union Leader Who Says She Can Get Teachers Back in Schools&lt;/a&gt;, the parallels from Lousiville - from the strong teachers union right down to how the public opinion on reopening breaks along racial lines - are stunning. Highly worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Three studies indicate that safe opening requires adequate social distancing &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; a low infection rate in the community, among other things: &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2775875&quot;&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-in-children-and-the-role-of-school-settings-in-transmission-first-update_1.pdf&quot;&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7004e3.htm&quot;&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Wilson</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="reopening" /><category term="covid" /><summary type="html">The decision on reopening will be on us, but real gaps and risks remain for teachers, families and the community as a whole.
